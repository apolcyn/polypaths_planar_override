Planar Documentation Contents
=============================

Planar is a 2D geometry library for Python designed for use by
games and other interactive applications.

Planar was created for use by the `Grease game framework <http://www.pygamesf.org/~casey/grease/doc/>`_, but is distributed as a separate standalone library so that it can be more useful for everyone.
